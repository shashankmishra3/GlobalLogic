        current captain of the Indian cricket team. <br />
        Considered as one of the best opening batters of all time, Rohit is
        known for his timing, elegance, six-hiting abilities and leadership
        skills.<br />
        He plays as a right-handed batsman for India national cricket team in
        international cricket, Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic
        cricket.<br />

          Experience
        </h1>
      </center>
      <p style="color: #800000; padding: 20px">
        With the retirements of stalwarts like Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman, a
        new crop of Test batsmen needed to be honed, and opened up new avenues
        in the team. <br />
        Rohit, at long last, earned the oh-so-desirable India Test cap against
        West Indies in the first Test at the Eden Gardens in his fabled
        'predecessor's' farewell series. Rohit wasn't going to let this
        opportunity go begging and embraced the Test arena immediately, easing
        his way to a typically Rohit-esque 177 in his debut innings; a vital
        innings in the context of the match, dragging the momentum India's
        way.<br />
        He reinforced his metaphorical statement to the selectors with an
        unbeaten 111 in the following Test, enchanting a tearful Wankhede in
        Sachin Tendulkar's farewell Test match and taming the West Indian
        bowling attack. <br />
        After an injury-break, Rohit, as if to make up for lost time, ripped
        apart a hapless Sri Lankan attack on his way to a jaw-dropping 264 –
        wait for it – in an ODI at the Eden Gardens, making thirteen runs more
        than the entire Lankan team managed.<br />

        However, a worrying trend continued after the selectors picked him for
        the tour to Australia after his Kolkata epic: that of getting picked for
        away Test tours based on white ball performances in less testing
        conditions.<br />
        He was picked after his 209 for the South Africa tour in late 2013 and
        looked technically inept in seaming conditions, committing to the line
        of the ball too early and playing as if it were a true wicket.<br />
        His strength of picking the length early in ODIs was turning into a
        curse in Test matches.<br />
        Similarly, having been picked for the tour of Australia on the back of
        his 264, he made just one fifty in 6 innings, looking completely at sea
        against the pace-heavy Australian attack, continuously playing away from
        the body, trying to hit through the line in conditions conducive to
        lateral movement and showing poor off-stump awareness.<br />
